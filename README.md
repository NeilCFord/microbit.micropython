# microbit.micropython

Some example programs written in [MicroPython](https://micropython.org/) for the [BBC micro:bit](https://www.microbit.co.uk/).

The BBC micro:bit MicroPython documentation can be found [here](https://microbit-micropython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). Quite a few of these example are taken from there.

I recommend using the [Mu](http://codewith.mu/) editor to write your MicroPython for your micro:bit. It is available for Windows, macOS and Linux and doesn't require an internet connection to work.

## The programs

* displayboat.py - displays a Blue Peter style sailing ship using data contained within the program.
* displayhappy.py - displays a happy face on the LED matrix.
* helloworld.py - scrolls "Hello, world" across the LED matrix.
* sinkingboat.py - takes the boat from displayboat.py and makes it sink. Demonstrates animation on the micro:bit.
* tickle.py - displays a happy face when pin 1 and GND are connected, otherwise displays a sad face.
* trafficlights.py - Using 3 LEDs, cycles through the standard traffic light sequence when Button A is pressed. Button B exits the program.
